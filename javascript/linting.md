# Linting

JavaScript is interpreted, so you won't know about bugs and errors until you run the code. Linting analyzes your code to find common problems which might cause bugs.

Linters can be implemented in code editors so you can see what errors there are in-line.

FamilySearch uses ESLint with a shared config. Linting can be a requirement for code quality and provides a good metric.
